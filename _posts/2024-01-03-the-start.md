# Introduction
2024 has rang. The new year is officially launched. What a time to start a project that has been on my mind for quite some time. This is not a work in progress. This is a learning and evolving project.

I don't exactly know where it will bring me, but I certainly will make sure there will be learning in the process, and not only for me. My goal is to share the knowledge and learn about the OpenSource community.

I always liked to write. So here is the reason of this blog. I want to develop my fluency at speaking and writing english (I'm french) so there will also be a Youtube Channel to support the material and maybe a podcast for reflexions.
