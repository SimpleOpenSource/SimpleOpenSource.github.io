# What are the choices?
Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, IOS and Windows Phone a.k.a every other system not working properly.

# What are the differences?
Before I ever compiled a c program printing "Hello world" to the screen, I always took for granted that Operating Systems were just a question of branding. You couldn't play games on a Mac because the material stuff inside was more for office tasks. Damn was I wrong.

Now most users interact with their computer the same way they could through any of the Operating Systems:
- Through the Browser, or Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, whatever.

But what they don't know is that the browser is in fact an application that needed to be implemented for their operating system. This implementation is done through coding.

So, here were are starting to grasp the world of coding, which is one hell of a rabbit hole.

You are reading this sentence, on an application coded by people using programming languages written by other people that were also used in the development of the Operating System they are writting the code on, which was written by other people, in probably other languages.

So what are the diffrences?
- Apps available are not the same, since everything has to be implemented for each system
- Implementing apps is not done the same way since the system doesn't work the same way underneath
- Installing apps is not the same since the system doesn't interact the same way
- Knowledge is not the same since there is proprietary vs open source (Mac vs Linux)

# What to chose?
You chose whatever you like.

Until my 25th birthday I have always used Windows. Then I had both Windows and Mac. Now, I have learned software development on Mac, I have professionaly worked with Windows and I spend my free time experimenting with Linux.

I find navigating between mac and Linux simple when interacting with the terminal since the commands are quite the same. I like the fact that Linux is open source and you have more control over your data. (Mac and Windows are taking baths in your golden personal data). That's why I will mostly guide my activities toward my Linux computer, which is a desktop. So, I will have to continue work on the Macbook pro when on the move (which is sometime only another room).

# What now?
I will try my best to provide links or information about the major three operating systems (others are mobile, and for now, don't try to develop from a mobile phone) when I go through installation of tools, applications, or whatever.
