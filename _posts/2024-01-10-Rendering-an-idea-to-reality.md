# What is happening here?
I started this blog to keep track on the development of a project I had in mind lately.

**Firstly:** I am frustrated about the state of the documentation available on internet. Before I started my journey in the world of software development, I always found that Google was the king in providing answers. Now, I find myself developping strategies in cross-searching [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Github](https://github.com), [reddit](https://reddit.com), official documentations and asking our beloved friend [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) in last resort.

**Secondly:** I always wanted to start a business, but never stopped myself at one idea where I decided to invest everything into. I find that now is the time to start that project, even without a fixed idea. I chose to believe that the process and the way of doing business is what matter and that the idea will come eventually. Since then I will set up the foundations one by one and eventually move in the direction of something clearer.

# Why rendering an idea to reality?
I find the word nice, and never really heard it before studying technology. The action of rendering something on the screen or in a web browser through our own code is gratifying, and this is what I will try to achieve through this project.

I want to render things into the screen of other people.

I want to create.

I want to render my ideas to reality by making them appear somewhere in the universe, even if for now, I am the only audience.

# What will be the focus and goals?
- Personal Goals
	- Learn english through writing and speaking
	- Develop my speaking capabilities
	- Become structured and well organized as well as learn things that will help me personnaly
		- Cybersecurity: Keeping my data and informations secure like a business does
	- Share my knowledge with others and provide value to others
	- Provide an environment where people can colaborate in an empowering way
- Professional Goals
	- Learn marketing through handling every social platforms and communications
	- Learn business and accounting through keeping track of expenses and incomes
	- Learn software development in all its aspects

# How will I render it?
The process will be a suite of articles about everything needed to do to implement something more. For example, for this to appear on a screen, I needed to generate a website and host it on the web. 

This right here is 2 articles already. One about how I will develop the website and a second one about how I will host it.

There can even be one more: Explaining operating systems since there will be differences between each one.

Let's start with the operating systems.
