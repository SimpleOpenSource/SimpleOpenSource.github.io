# What is appsheet?
Appsheet is a Google online service to help business build mobile and web apps based on spreadsheets or databases.

It is easy to build a simple app such as a contact book where data is tabular, meaning it can be stored into rows with different column values. The app can be deployed to Google Play Store or the App store for business to share them with their employees, in exchange of a cost.

Where it becomes interesting is their engagement to make it forever free for people to test it individually or up to 10 users on a app.

Basically, it allows us to create an app available on multi-platform (ios, android and web browsers), at no cost, to store and track our personal data.

Since the data is stored in a spreadsheet, it is easy to create backups on other cloud providers than the one used for the app, or even directly on personal hard drives.

# How am I using it?
I've been experimenting with appsheet for a few years now. I've built multiple applications that I've rebuilt from scratch again and again to track my personal goals and metrics.

Before appsheet, I was one for those Excel or Google Sheets preachers, which I still am, that tried to do everything with the tabular storing software.

Now, I currently have a great personal finances app where I track all my finances, monitor my budget and generate a clear picture of my financial life.

Secondly, I have another app for journaling and keeping track of my weight and other metrics related to my goals.

I love the fact that I'm not dependant of a 3rd party that might eventually charge for their service, or pay for an app that might not provide all the customization I would like.

# Why ?
I am sharing my knowledge about appsheet because I think it can be a simple tool to use when provided with a simple tutorial on the basics that can provide a lot of value to people that wants to track data.

We all want to track data, but often miss the tools. Before I was building great spreadsheet files to track my finances, only to stop on filing in data because I wasn't using a desktop computer for a period of time. Now the app can follow me everywhere and is pretty simple for data additions.

For example, would you all like to have a shared recipe book in live with the family? You could build that with appsheet! In fact I might do the tutorial on this subject!
